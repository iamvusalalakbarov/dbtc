          DBTC stands for "Don't Break The Chain" which is a famous methodology
          created by Jerry Seinfeld. He used this methodology to improve his
          skills about comedy, but it is suitable for everyone who needs to get
          a progress on anything; it can be reading a book, doing some sport or
          famously — learning programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          The methodology is simple: You decide for your goal, get a calendar
          and everday after doing your goal put a cross on the respective day of
          calendar. Then your new goal is not to break the chain formed by
          crosses.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a developer of this project, I learned this methodology from
          Turkish youtuber Barış Özcan. He prepares videos on this concept at
          every New Year's Eve and encourages his subscribers to define New Year
          goals. I learned lots of my programming skills with the help of this
          methodology by applying it to my daily life. Then I decided to create
          a website on this topic by using the skills I learned.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nowadays, everything becomes virtual; so I thought it is also a need
          to apply this methodology not on a paper, on a web app instead. As
          foreigner students like me, it is really hard to keep those things on
          a paper and carry it with you without hurting or damaging it. That's
          the real reason behind the project idea.
